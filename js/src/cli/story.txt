:: outside_the_abbey
The abbey stands in a sea of hazy hot desert, with its single clock tower jutting towards the blue sky like a lighthouse. The sun beats down relentlessly on its stone-white walls, and burns the back of your neck as you approach the front gate. You had overheard that the Abbey of St. Elspeth Citharede was looking for an adventurer. To what end you did not know, but the unusual request had been more than enough to capture your interest. Approaching the front gate, a person clothed in white robes shuffles to her feet. Perhaps this is one of the Abbey Sisters. SISTER CATHERINA: Thank Saradomin! You must be the adventurer the abbess prayed for! My name is Sister Catherina. Our abbess asked me to wait here for you to arrive. Will you help us Adventurer? Sister Catherine looks at you expectantly. What do you say; yes or no?

NARRATOR: Sister Catherina leads you through the ornate front gate of the abbey and into its paved courtyard where a flowing fountain stands in midst of the dry desert. The abbey certainly has a humble air about it, from its worn white walls to the lack of any fanciful decoration; the whole place is a testament to the simple and devoted lifestyle the Sisters must lead within and their dedication of worship to their god, Saradomin. Off to the side of the courtyard, Sister Catherina stops outside a dark wooden door. ABBESS BENITA: Come in. NARRATOR: You enter the room. A small room which appears to be more of an office than a place of worship. Behind a large desk sits an older woman, dressed in the same white robes as Sister Catherina. Her face has much more of a serious, authoritative, gaze, and wrinkled lines suggest a lifetime of devotion. ABBESS BENITA: Ah. You must be an adventurer who has heard our call. Thank Saradomin you’ve come. I’m the Abbess; Abbess Benita. I've called you here for a sensitive task - one that I would prefer to deal with quietly, without involving the Church authorities. Sister Catherina, please leave us. NARRATOR: The Abbess looks down at her desk, carefully replacing her ink quill. ABBESS BENITA: One of our sisters, Sister Anna, has been, I believe, murdered. Murdered quite brutally. I need you to investigate, for I fear the killer may still be in the abbey. I’m sure you must have some questions so please, ask them. NARRATOR: The Abbess waits for your question. Do you ask about the murder or why she's sad?

ABBESS BENITA: Sister Anna was one of our most devoted sisters, and, a trusted friend. She was exactly what we should aspire to be; humble and committed to our worship of Saradomin. I last saw her after the afternoon prayer service, but when she didn’t turn up for the evening service, I went to her cell and there found her body. It was…horrific. The injuries were so severe that I had to stop myself from screaming. It wouldn’t be right to scare the other Sisters so…I moved the body to the infirmary and cleaned and wrapped it myself. I’ve forbidden the other sisters from seeing it. NARRATOR: Despite the abbess’ stern composure, you notice she is trembling. ABBESS BENITA: Please. The abbey is open for you to investigate. I will accompany you so you don’t get lost. I don’t mean to tell you how to proceed. But what would you like to do next? Would you like to go to Anna's cell or to the infirmary or talk to the sisters?

NARRATOR: The Abbess leads you through the abbey towards the infirmary. Around you, the life of worship seems to be continuing unabated in spite of a lingering threat. Eventually the abbess stops at a wooden door. ABBESS BENITA: I shall wait here so as to ensure you’re not disturbed. Please, be respectful. NARRATOR: You enter the infirmary and approach the body, lifting the white sheet which covers it. Indeed, the body has been cleaned and put in burial robes. You take a look at the face; it has been horribly mutilated. The front of the skull has been bludgeoned in, and the skin of the face has been removed. On the back of the head you find a blunt force wound, as if she was hit by a heavy object. There is a row of three deep stab wounds in the victim's chest, one of them piercing her heart. The victim's feet have been heavily mutilated. Several toes have been cut off. Taking a moment to ensure you haven't missed anything you pull the sheet back over the body and return to the Abbess.

The abbess stops at a door with the name ‘Sister Anna’ painted across it. The room is small and sparse of furniture apart from an uncomfortable looking bed and at the foot of it, a chest. The bare stone walls are without decoration. A warm breeze hits you, drawing your attention to the one solitary window. ABBESS BENITA: I’ve kept the room locked since I found the body. Nobody has been in here since, not even to clean. NARRATOR: Would you like to check the bed, the chest or the window?

The sister nods and gets up to walk towards you. You recognise her as Sister Catherina, who met you at the front gate. SISTER CATHERINA: Oh, adventurer. It is good to see you again. The Abbess says you would like to speak to me in regards to what I was doing before the evening service? NARRATOR: The Sister smiles politely. SISTER CATHERINA Well, I was in the scriptorium – in the basement - copying a manuscript from the Book of Saradomin. I’m going through the entire book, transcribing it all. There’s quite a lot, and, well, I think I’ve gotten quite good at it. It makes me feel somewhat proud, although I know that’s not a feeling I should indulge. Oh! But, uhm, I found it quite difficult though. What with the music and sounds of the party coming from outside the abbey. Do you know about that? It’s not that I disapprove of what they are doing, but I so used to love dancing before I joined here. It’s certainly tempting to join in.. NARRATOR: Sister Catherina shuffles, rubbing her arm. SISTER CATHERINA: I think, well...I know, Sister Anna wouldn’t be impressed by me saying that. She was quite strict and at first frightened me. I’m not surprised the applicant who was here yesterday left without a word. So...do you have any other questions for me? NARRATOR: It seems there is more that you could learn from Sister Catherina. Do you ask about the manuscript or the applicant?

A lot of applicants realise the life here isn't for them and leave. If it’s ok, I should return to my writing. I hope I have helped you in some way adventurer.

The abbess walks over to a sister, who surrounded by sheets of musical notation, appears to be leading the choir, waving her arms and conducting. The abbess beckons her to talk with you. SISTER CECILIA: Look at me...look at me... Okay, that's good. Remember to look at me so you can keep in time. Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't, er...Ladies, keep rehearsing. I need to talk to someone. ABBESS BENITA: Adventurer, this is Sister Cecilia. She leads the choir here in the abbey. Sister, would you be so kind as to tell the adventurer where you were yesterday evening? SISTER CECILIA: I was here. Leading the choir in practice of a new hymn to Saint Elspeth. I wrote the music, and might I add it's better music than those…dancers outside the abbey. I have no idea why they are here, but I detest dancing. It’s so...unthoughtful. So unholy. Do you know the story of Saint Elspeth and the Ripper Demon? I’d be happy to tell you. It’s a very important story to all the sisters here. NARRATOR: Do you ask about the story or the music?

SISTER CECILIA: So, the story is about The Ripper. An assassin demon. It would strike without warning and leave its victims horribly mutilated. Stab them through the heart with terrible claws, tear off their faces... Zamorak, the god of chaos, sent the Ripper to attack a village where Saint Elspeth was staying. But, it couldn't approach while she was singing. Her voice and singing was so holy. So it waited on the edge of the village. She sang for days, but eventually she was too weak to go on. She went out of the village to face the demon alone - she thought it might just kill her and spare the villagers. A noble sacrifice. She fought the demon and it mortally wounded her; but, as she was dying, Saradomin granted her the strength to sing one piercing note so perfect that it struck the demon dead. Her remains lay unburied until the present age. Then, seventy years ago, a group of holy women found them and built this abbey in her memory. That's why music is such an important part of our worship. Now if you’ll excuse me, I really must get back to helping the choir. NARRATOR: Sister Cecilia nods curtly and returns to conducting the choir, leaving you with the Abbess.

NARRATOR: The abbess' face flashes a look of disapproval, leading you towards the main gates of the abbey and points over to the troubadour and his camp. ABBESS BENITA: Very well. I don’t know why they are here outside the Abbey. He and his party seem to come and go quite often. It’s not that I don’t respect their choice of...lifestyle, but I don’t want the sisters being distracted at this time. NARRATOR: Leaving the Abbess at the gate, you walk over to the colourful tent where a number of people are dancing. Amongst them a brightly dressed man is playing a mandolin and singing. NARRATOR: From his wide hat, sun kissed skin and open waistcoat the man has a very carefree air about him. He ceases his singing as you near, greeting you with a broad smile. VALERIO: Greetings, traveller! The name’s Valerio. I do hope we’re not causing any trouble. We just thought we’d help liven the desert up a bit. Everyone should enjoy dancing once in awhile, especially if there is some coin to be made! NARRATOR: Do you ask why he's here or what his life is like?"

NARRATOR: Valerio’s wide smile slowly disappears, the musician looking very forlorn. VALERIO: Ah. I guess, it is more than a little strange that we would be here, outside an abbey huh? Well, if you want the truth...one of the sisters here, Sister Anna, she passed away recently. I knew her before she joined the abbey, so I've come to pay my respects. I tried to talk her out of coming here, but when she made her mind up about something, there was nothing that could stop her. NARRATOR: Valerio falls silent for a moment, his gaze falling to the sand, as if recalling some distant memory before with a shake of his head he returns. VALERIO: That is the truth of why I’m here. Even a religious order isn't completely cut off from the world. Word gets around. Now, if you’ll excuse me I think some music is required to lift the mood. NARRATOR: You return to the Abbess who is waiting by the front gate. ABBESS BENITA: The bells shouldn’t be ringing at this time. What is Sister Debora up to…

NARRATOR: Leading the way, the abbess takes you through the abbey to a room near the front gate. ABBESS BENITA: I’m not sure what help this will be. The applicant who was here was being interviewed by Sister Anna but must have left yesterday. I didn’t see her leave though. Anyway, this is the room where all the applicants stay. NARRATOR: You walk into a room which has a couple of beds. Searching around there doesn't seem to be anything amiss but, as you turn to leave, you notice something just behind the door. Reaching round you retrieve a piece of cloth, the colour and feel of which is immediately familiar. ABBESS BENITA: A moment. Let me take a look at that. This is most peculiar. Again, not something the sisters of the Abbey would wear and it seems....it seems to match the one you found in Sister Anna's cell. I wonder if- What in the name of Saradomin... What is Sister Deborah doing up there? The bell shouldn’t be sounding at this time! Though, that does remind me. It wouldn’t hurt to go talk to her as well at some point.

There, a lady in abbey robes, red faced with   an apron bound severely around her midriff, is busily stirring various pots while steam billows up and slides around the ceiling. ABBESS BENITA: Ah, that’s Sister Elena. She’s in charge of the kitchens here. You may talk to her if you like. Would you like to go to the clock tower or talk to Sister Elena?

I went down to the cellar to get some supplies at one point, but the rest of the time I was here. Actually, I noticed something while I was down there. I think someone's been stealing food from the cellar. I bet it was Sister Catherina. I've seen her sneaking an extra cup of wine at meals, and I bet she’s just the sort to want to flirt with that rabble outside. As for Sister Anna...she's with Saradomin now. It doesn't matter what I thought of her, and it does no good to speak ill of the dead. Now. Is there something else you need? NARRATOR: Do you ask her about Sister Anna or how to make cabbage soup?

SISTER ELENA: Now, I know what you might be thinking. I didn’t say I didn’t like her. But she did cause conflict. Most of the sisters didn't see it, but I did. She was always arguing with the abbess. Sister Anna thought Sister Benita was too lenient with the order's rules. Anna would have enforced silence outside of services. She'd have stopped Sister Cecilia composing - prescribed melodies only. Maybe it's Saradomin's will that Sister Anna never got to become abbess. Now. I need to head to the basement for some ingredients. Out with you! NARRATOR: You leave the kitchen by the threatening flick of a dishcloth at your back. ABBESS BENITA: You’ll have to excuse Sister Elena, she isn’t the most... accommodating when busy.

Get rid of the outer leaves then cut the whole thing into bite sized pieces like this… ABBESS BENITA: Ah, uhm, Sister Elena? I don’t think- SISTER ELENA: Throw it all in a pot! Then you have to add the water. How much will depend on how many you’re cooking for. Cover it. Just like that, and then put it on a low heat. Low, did you hear me? People think they can cook food faster by just whacking it on the hottest thing they have. No no.

ABBESS BENITA: Ah Sister Debora. I assume you’re in the middle of fixing things? If you wouldn’t mind I’d appreciate if you could talk a little about Sister Anna. I know it might be hard. SISTER DEBORA: Sister Ban-ana? No no. You must mean Sister Anna. Well, a part breaks that you'd expected to hold for years...but that doesn't stop the whole mechanism, it just sets it in a different direction. Saradomin is a better clock-maker than us.

NARRATOR: The wall of sound hits you with such force it blacks out your vision for a moment, disorientating you. Sister Debora on the other hand stands there unaffected, like nothing has happened.

ABBESS BENITA: Interesting. In that case, perhaps we- Did you hear that? Quick! Follow the sound of that scream! NARRATOR: Leaving the office, you and the Abbess both run in the direction of the scream. The desperate wails get louder and louder the deeper you go into the abbey. You come to a room where the wooden hatch to the basement is open. Thundering down the stairs you enter into the dim light of the basement. A body lays stretched out, blood pooling around it on the stone floor. The pristine white robes now soaked in crimson along with the apron tied around the front. The apron of Sister Elena. Sister Cecilia cowers in the corner, shaking. SISTER CECILIA: I saw it! It was the demon! It was the Ripper! NARRATOR: End of Act 1. The next part of One Piercing Note will be available soon.
