NARRATOR
The abbey stood in a sea of hazy hot desert, with its single clock tower jutting towards the blue sky like a lighthouse.
The relentless sun beat down upon its stone white walls and you, as you approached the front gate.
You had overheard that the Abbey of St. Elspeth Citharede was looking for an adventurer.
To what end you did not know, but the unusual request had been more than enough to capture your interest.
Approaching the front gate, a person clothed in white robes shuffles to her feet. Perhaps this was one of the Abbey Sisters.

SISTER CATHERINA:
(with relief)
Thank Saradomin! You must be the adventurer the abbess prayed for!
My name is Sister Catherina. Our abbess asked me to wait here for you to arrive.
Will you help us, adventurer?

Sister Catherine looks at you expectantly. What do you do? Do you say; yes, or, no?

Are you...certain you can’t help us?

NARRATOR
Sister Catherina leads you through the ornate front gate of the abbey and into its paved courtyard where a flowing fountain
stands in midst of the dry desert. The abbey certainly has a humble air about it, from its worn white walls to the lack of
any fanciful decoration; the whole place is a testament to the simple and devoted lifestyle the Sisters must lead within and their dedication of worship to their god, Saradomin.
Off to the side of the courtyard, Sister Catherina stops outside a dark wooden door before knocking.

SOUND EFFECT: KNOCKING

ABBESS BENITA
(from behind the door)
Come in.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR CREAKING OPEN

NARRATOR
You enter the room. A small room which appears to be more of an office than a place of worship.
Behind a large desk sits an older woman, dressed in the same white robes as Sister Catherina.
Her face has much more of a serious gaze, and wrinkled lines suggest a lifetime of devotion. Her looks are one of authority if not, something weighing heavily on her mind.

ABBESS BENITA
(seriously)
Ah. You must be an adventurer who has heard our call. Thank Saradomin you’ve come. I’m the Abbess; Abbess Benita.
I've called you here for a sensitive task - one that I would prefer to deal with quietly, without involving the Church authorities.
Sister Catherina, please leave us.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR CLOSING
NARRATOR
The Abbess pauses for a second. Somewhat hesitant to continue.

ABBESS BENITA
(with slight apprehension)
One of our sisters, Sister Anna, has been, I believe, murdered. Murdered quite brutally. I need you to investigate,
for I fear the killer may still be in the abbey. I’m sure you must have some questions so please, ask, and I will try and tell you all I know.

NARRATOR
The Abbess waits for your question.
What do you do? Do you ask about; details of the murder, OR, her favourite food?
<<choice [[the details of the murder|ask_murder]]>> |\
<<choice [[her favourite food|ask_food]]>>

NARRATOR
She nods in agreement and continues.

ABBESS BENITA
(with slight hesitation)
Sister Anna was one of our most devoted sisters, and, a trusted friend. She was exactly what we should aspire to be;
humble and committed to our worship of Saradomin.
I last saw her at Vespers…it’s a prayer service, yesterday. When she wasn't present at Compline later in the evening however,
I went to her cell and there found her body.
It was…horrific. The injuries were so severe that I had to stop myself from screaming. It wouldn’t be right to scare the other Sisters
so…I moved the body to the infirmary and cleaned and wrapped it myself. I’ve forbidden the other sisters from seeing it.

NARRATOR
The Abbess clears her throat as she recounts the details. Despite her stern composure, she is trembling.
It must have been a harrowing experience.

ABBESS BENITA
(more determinedly)
Please. The whole abbey is open for you to investigate. I will accompany you so you don’t get lost.

SOUND EFFECT: SOUND OF CHAIR BEING PUSHED BACK. THE ABBESS IS STANDING UP.

I don’t mean to tell you how to proceed. But what will you do? Would you like to; go to Sister Anna’s cell,
OR, go to the infirmary, OR talk to the Sisters?

NARRATOR
The Abbess leads you through the abbey towards the infirmary. Around you, the life of worship seems to be continuing unabated.
The sisters unaware of the threat of a murderer that still perhaps lingers within the abbey itself. Eventually the abbess stops at a wooden door.

SOUND EFFECT: CLINKING OF KEYS. DOOR BEING UNLOCKED THEN OPENED.

ABBESS BENITA
I shall wait here so as to ensure you’re not disturbed. Please be, respectful.

NARRATOR
You enter the infirmary and approach the body, lifting the white sheet which covers it.
Indeed, the body has been cleaned and put in burial robes.
You take a look at the face; it has been horribly mutilated. The front of the skull has been bludgeoned in,
and the skin of the face has been removed. On the back of the head you find a blunt force wound, as if she was hit by a heavy object.
There is a row of three deep stab wounds in the victim's chest, one of them piercing her heart.
The victim's feet have been heavily mutilated. Several toes have been cut off.

Taking a moment to ensure you haven't missed anything you pull the sheet back over the body and return to the Abbess.

NARRATOR
The two of you walk through the abbey into the residence wing.  You stop at a door with the name ‘Sister Anna’ painted across it.
The Abbess takes an iron key from her robes and turns it in the lock, pushing the door open to let you enter.

SOUND EFFECT: DOOR BEING UNLOCKED AND OPENED. ABBEY AMBIENCE FADES OUT
INT. SISTER ANNA CELL – DAY

The room is small and sparse of furniture apart from an uncomfortable looking bed and a shelf of books.
The bare stone walls are without decoration. A warm breeze hits you drawing your attention to the one solitary window.

ABBESS BENITA
I’ve kept the room locked since I found the body. Nobody has been in here since, not even to clean.

NARRATOR:
Walking towards the small window you notice that it is smashed, however there appears to be no glass in the room itself suggesting,
perhaps, it was broken from the inside.
Noting this, you take a look through the shelf of books however nothing seems to be out of the ordinary there.
Lastly you look at the bed. It is neatly made, though looks extremely uncomfortable. Kneeling down you reach around underneath
until…your fingers touch upon something soft.
Pulling it out you reveal a piece of cloth.

ABBESS BENITA
(curiously)
That looks like a piece of clothing, but it doesn't match any of the robes the Sisters wear. How strange.

NARRATOR:
The Abbess looks puzzled by this find, while you take one last glance around the room. There doesn’t seem to be anything else out of the ordinary.

NARRATOR
Leading you through the Abbey, the Abbess approaches one of the sisters who is sat at a wooden desk, writing.
As she gets up to walk towards you, you recognise her as Sister Catherina, who met you at the abbey front gate.

SISTER CATHERINA
(politely)
Oh, adventurer. It is good to see you again. The Abbess says you would like to speak to me in regards to what I was doing last night?

NARRATOR
The Sister looks a bit uncertain, but continues.

SISTER CATHERINA
Well, I was in the scriptorium – in the basement - copying a manuscript from the Book of Saradomin. There’s quite a lot, and,
well, I think I’ve gotten quite good at it. It makes me feel somewhat proud, although I know that’s not a feeling I should indulge.

It was quite hard though what with the music coming from outside the abbey. Not that I dislike what Valerio is doing outside,
but I so used to love dancing before I joined the abbey. It’s certainly tempting to join in. Sister Anna wouldn’t be impressed by me saying that.
She was quite strict and at first frightened me.
I’m not surprised the applicant who was here yesterday left without a word.

Oh! You probably don't know. An applicant came to the abbey yesterday. Her name was Isabella.
I heard Sister Anna forced her to sing but wasn’t impressed that she couldn’t do it well.
She disappeared yesterday noon. She probably went home. A lot of applicants realise the life here isn't for them and leave.
If it’s ok, I should return to my writing. I hope I have helped you in some way adventurer.

NARRATOR
Sister Catherina gives you a smile, then turns and walks back to her desk.

You follow the Abbess up a white stone staircase and venture into the chapel hall. Unlike the rest of the abbey,
the large hall is finely decorated; coloured marble covering the floor and pillars that stretch up to the arched ceiling.
The abbess ventures over to a sister, who surrounded by sheets of musical notation, appears to be leading the choir,
waving her arms and conducting. The abbess beckons her to talk with you.

SISTER CECILIA
Look at me...look at me... Okay, that's good. Remember to look at me so you can keep in time. Oh! I'm sorry,
I didn't, er...Ladies, keep rehearsing. I need to talk to someone.

SOUND EFFECT: THE CHOIR FADE OUT BUT CONTINUE IN THE BACKGROUND

NARRATOR
The Sister comes over and the Abbess introduces her as Sister Cecilia. The abbess asks her where she was yesterday evening.

SISTER CECILIA
I was here. Leading the choir in practice of a new hymn to Saint Elspeth. I wrote the music, and might I add it's better
music than those…dancers outside the abbey. I have no idea why they are here, but I detest dancing. Singing is much more holy.
Do you know the story of Saint Elspeth and the Ripper Demon? I’d be happy to tell you. It’s a very important story to all the sisters here.

NARRATOR

Do you ask about; the story, or, musical chords?
<<choice [[story|the_story]]>> |\

:: the_story
NARRATOR
Sister Cecilia nods and starts to relate the story behind her hymn.

SISTER CECILIA
The Ripper was an assassin demon. It would strike without warning and leave its victims horribly mutilated.
Stab them through the heart with terrible claws, tear off their faces...
Zamorak, the god of chaos, sent the Ripper to attack a village where Saint Elspeth was staying.
But, it couldn't approach while she was singing. Her voice and singing was so holy.
So it waited on the edge of the village. She sang for days, but eventually she was too weak to go on.
She went out of the village to face the demon alone - she thought it might just kill her and spare the villagers. A noble sacrifice.

She fought the demon and it mortally wounded her; but, as she was dying, Saradomin granted her the strength to sing one
piercing note so perfect that it struck the demon dead. Her remains lay unburied until the present age. Then, seventy years ago,
a group of holy women found them and built this abbey in her memory. That's why music is such an important part of our worship.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I really must get back to helping the choir.

NARRATOR
You thank Sister Cecilia. She smiles and returns to conducting the choir leaving you with the Abbess.

ABBESS BENITA
Very well. I don’t know why they are here outside the Abbey. He and his party seem to come and go quite often.
It’s not that I don’t respect their choice of...lifestyle, but I don’t want the sisters being distracted at this time.

NARRATOR
Leaving the Abbess at the gate, you walk over to the colorful tent where a number of people are dancing.
Amongst them a brightly dressed man is playing a mandolin and singing.

EXT. VALERIO CAMP – DAY
SOUND EFFECT: VALERIO SINGING & MUSIC FOR A WHILE

NARRATOR
From his wide hat, sun kissed skin and open waistcoat the man has a very carefree air about him. He ceases his singing as you near,
greeting you with an infectious smile.

VALERIO
(happily)
Greetings, traveller! The name’s Valerio.
I do hope we’re not causing any trouble. We just thought we’d help liven the desert up a bit.
Everyone should enjoy dancing once in awhile, especially if there is some coin to be made!

Valerio’s wide smile slowly disappears, the musician looking very forlorn. The facade fading away.

VALERIO
(stark honesty / sadly)
Ah. I guess, it is more than a little strange that we would be here, outside an abbey huh?
Very well...one of the sisters here, Sister Anna, she passed away recently. I knew her before she joined the abbey, so I've come to pay my respects.

I knew her before she joined the abbey. I tried to talk her out of coming here, but when she made her mind up about something, there was nothing that could stop her.

NARRATOR
Valerio falls silent for a moment, his gaze falling to the sand, as if recalling some distant memory before with a shake of his head he returns.

VALERIO
(sounding a little more determined)
That is the truth of why I’m here. Even a religious order isn't completely cut off from the world. Word gets around.
Now, if you’ll excuse me I think some music is required to lift the mood.

NARRATOR
You return to the Abbess who is waiting by the front gate.

SOUND EFFECT: THE BELL FROM THE CLOCK TOWER RINGS OUT. CUTTING THE ABBESS OFF.

I’m not sure what help this will be. The applicant who was here must have left yesterday, though I didn’t see her leave.
This is the room where all the applicants come and are interviewed by the sisters. I do know Sister Anna conducted the interview yesterday.

NARRATOR
You walk into a simple room with a few desks and wooden benches within, set out like a classroom.
Searching around there doesn't seem to be anything amiss but, as you turn to leave, you notice something just behind the door.

Reaching round you retrieve a piece of cloth, the colour and feel of which is immediately familiar.

ABBESS BENITA
A moment. Let me take a look at that.

NARRATOR
The abbess takes the cloth and examines it further.

ABBESS BENITA
This is most peculiar. Again, not something the sisters of the Abbey would wear and it seems....it seems to match the one you found in Sister Anna's cell. I wonder if-

There, a lady in abbey robes, red faced and in an apron, is busily stirring various pots while steam billows up and slides around the ceiling.

and about Sister Anna. She waits outside, leaving the two of you to talk.

SISTER ELENA
(annoyed / impatient)
I was here, in the kitchen. Why, where should I have been? I went down to the cellar to get some supplies at one point,
but the rest of the time I was here. Actually, I noticed something while I was down there. I think someone's been stealing food from the cellar.
I bet it was Sister Catherina. I've seen her sneaking an extra cup of wine at meals, and I bet she’s just the sort to want to flirt with that rabble outside.

As for Sister Anna...she's with Saradomin now. It doesn't matter what I thought of her, and it does no good to speak ill of the dead.

Now, I know what you might be thinking. I didn’t say I didn’t like her. But she did cause conflict. Most of the sisters didn't see it,
but I did. She was always arguing with the abbess.
Sister Anna thought Sister Benita was too lenient with the order's rules. Anna would have enforced silence outside of services.
She'd have stopped Sister Cecilia composing - prescribed melodies only. Maybe it's Saradomin's will that Sister Anna never got to become abbess.

Now. I need to head to the basement for some ingredients. Out with you!

NARRATOR
You leave the kitchen by the threatening flick of a tea-towel at your back.

ABBESS BENITA
You’ll have to excuse Sister Elena, she isn’t the most...accommodating when busy.

SISTER ELENA
(energetic – Jamie Oliver mode)
You want to know how I make my cabbage soup? Well, let me tell you!

SOUND EFFECT: RANDOM FOOD PREPARATION NOISES (CHOPPING, SCRAPING…ETC)

First you need some onions and carrots, just to help take the edge off a bit. Slice and dice them, see? Then take your cabbage.
We grow all our own you know. Right here in the abbey. Get rid of the outer leaves then cut the whole thing into bite sized pieces like this…

NARRATOR
The abbess tries to interrupt, unsuccessfully.

SISTER ELENA
Throw it all in a pot. Then you have to add the water. How much will depend on how many you’re cooking for.
Cover it. Just like that, and then put it on a low heat. Low, did you hear me? People think they can cook food faster by
just whacking it on the hottest thing they have. No no. We respect patience in this abbey and more so in this kitchen…

NARRATOR
This was the wrong question to ask.
What do you do? You may; ask about Sister Anna.

<<set $continueClockTower = 1>>
NARRATOR
Climbing some wooden stairs, you head up into the stone clock tower which raises above the abbey. Stopping at a
floor housing all the clock machinery, obscured by large cogs and metal beams, are two feet. Could this be, another bod-

SISTER DEBORAH
(loud, a call out)
Sister Catherina? Is that you?

NARRATOR
The feet wriggle.

SISTER DEBORAH
It's no good, Catherina, I just can't hear you. I'll be out of here in a minute, just need to get the, uh...
Could you do me a favour, Catherina? That lever over there. Could you pull it until you hear the right sound.
What was it now...oh yes, it'll be like two crunches followed by a CLUNK!
Tell me when you've heard that please!

NARRATOR
Do you; use the lever, OR, say done?
<<choice [[use the lever|use_the_lever]]>> |\

SISTER DEBORA
Nope. Nope that doesn't seem right.
Pull the lever again would you. Remember, it should sound like two crunches followed by a CLUNK!

Pulling the lever, the cogs suddenly start to turn…

NARRATOR
Suddenly the cogs begin to whurr in seamless unison, theinner workings of the clock tower coming alive around you with mechanical glory.

SISTER DEBORA
Yep! That’s it! Let me just get out here…

NARRATOR
The feet begin to wriggle towards you revealing an abbey robeuntil an elderly woman with white hair and thick brimmed glasses,
her eyes magnified, stands up in front of you.

SISTER DEBORA
(surprised)
There! Oh. I'm terribly sorry. I thought you were Sister Catherina. She's normally the one who comes up here. Oh and Abbess Benita. What can I do for you?

NARRATOR
The Abbess explains how you are helping her with a matter of importance, and that you wish to know where Sister
Debora was yesterday and her impressions of Sister Anna. She then turns to walk back down the stairs.

SISTER DEBORA
(mishearing - think Madame Fanny La Fan from ‘Allo ‘Allo)
Sister Ban-ana? No no. You must mean Sister Anna. Well, a part breaks that you'd expected to hold for years...but that
doesn't stop the whole mechanism, it just sets it in a different direction. Saradomin is a better clock-maker than us.
 As for yesterday I was here, repairing the clock. As you can see it’s been playing up a bit.

NARRATOR
What do you do?
Do you ask; why the crypt response, or, what she did before the abbey?
<<choice [[why the crypt response|why_the_crypt_response]]>> |\

:: why_the_crypt_response
NARRATOR
Sister Debora’s eyes blink at you through her huge glasses.

SISTER DEBORA
Sister Benita was planning to retire as abbess next year. Everyone expected Sister Anna to become the new abbess.
But it seems that wasn't Saradomin's plan, so he's taken her away. The clock runs, just not as we'd expected.

SOUND EFFECT: THE BELL RINGS INCREDIBLY LOUDLY, ENDING WITH EAR RINGING.

NARRATOR
The wall of sound hits you with such force it blacks out your vision for a moment, disorientating you.
Sister Debora on the other hand stands there unaffected, like nothing has happened.

SISTER DEBORA
(completely normal)
Are you listening? I said, I need to do some work. Can you hear it? One of these cogs needs some oil.

NARRATOR
Carefully, descending back down the wooden staircase you rejoin with the Abbess.

SISTER DEBORA
I’ve always been a clockmaker. Before I came here I used to live in a city called Ardougne and
worked for...what’s the name, you know, a man with the hat. Oh yes. The King. But then rumour began that there was a plague.
So I left and joined the abbey, here.

You return to the office of the abbess and she sits, drawing up a chair behind her desk.

SOUND EFFECT: CHAIR BEING SLID ACROSS THE STONE FLOOR

ABBESS BENITA
So, you've explored a lot of the abbey and talked to many of the Sisters here. I have to ask; do you think you know who the murderer is?

NARRATOR
You consider your options. What do you say?
Is it; one of the sisters? Someone else?, OR, are you not sure?

NARRATOR
The Abbess sits back in her chair, steepling her fingers while considering your response.
She moves forward to speak, when just at that moment-

SOUND EFFECT: A SCREAM ECHOS FROM OUTSIDE THE ROOM

NARRATOR
The Abbess’ eyes go wide. A silent shock drawing across her face.

ABBESS BENITA
(urgently)
Did you hear that? Quick! Follow the sound of that scream!

SOUND EFFECT: URGENT PUSHING BACK OF A CHAIR AND THE OPENING OF A DOOR. THE SCREAM OCCASIONALLY CONTINUES.

NARRATOR
Leaving the office, you and the Abbess both run in the direction of the scream. Its desperate wails getting louder and
louder the deeper you go into the abbey. You come to a room where the wooden hatch to the basement is open.
Thundering down the stairs you enter into the dim light of the basement and are met with a horrific sight.
A body lays stretched out, blood pooling about the stone floor, and staining the white robes along with an apron.
The apron of Sister Elena.
Sister Cecilia stands nearby, her hand to her mouth in a silent scream.

SISTER CECILIA
(hysterical & panicked)
I saw it! It was the demon! It was the Ripper!

NARRATOR
You have reached the end of Act 1. The next act will be added shortly.
Come back soon to complete the mystery of, One Piercing Note.
