Approaching the front gate, a person clothed in white robes shuffles to her feet. Perhaps this is one of the Abbey Sisters. SISTER CATHERINA: Thank Saradomin! You must be the adventurer the abbess prayed for! My name is Sister Catherina. Our abbess asked me to wait here for you to arrive. Will you help us Adventurer? Sister Catherine looks at you expectantly. What do you say; yes or no?"

The abbey certainly has a humble air about it, from its worn white walls to the lack of any fanciful decoration; the whole place is a testament to the simple and devoted lifestyle the Sisters must lead within and their dedication of worship to their god, Saradomin. Off to the side of the courtyard, Sister Catherina stops outside a dark wooden door. ABBESS BENITA: Come in. NARRATOR: You enter the room. A small room which appears to be more of an office than a place of worship. Behind a large desk sits an older woman, dressed in the same white robes as Sister Catherina. Her face has much more of a serious, authoritative, gaze, and wrinkled lines suggest a lifetime of devotion. ABBESS BENITA: Ah. You must be an adventurer who has heard our call. Thank Saradomin you’ve come. I’m the Abbess; Abbess Benita. I've called you here for a sensitive task - one that I would prefer to deal with quietly, without involving the Church authorities. Sister Catherina, please leave us. NARRATOR: The Abbess looks down at her desk, carefully replacing her ink quill. ABBESS BENITA: One of our sisters, Sister Anna, has been, I believe, murdered. Murdered quite brutally. I need you to investigate, for I fear the killer may still be in the abbey. I’m sure you must have some questions so please, ask them. NARRATOR: The Abbess waits for your question. Do you ask about the murder or why she's sad?"

The abbess stops at a door with the name ‘Sister Anna’ painted across it. The room is small and sparse of furniture apart from an uncomfortable looking bed and at the foot of it, a chest. The bare stone walls are without decoration. A warm breeze hits you, drawing your attention to the one solitary window. ABBESS BENITA: I’ve kept the room locked since I found the body. Nobody has been in here since, not even to clean. NARRATOR: Would you like to check the bed, the chest or the window?"

The abbess asks if she would be so kind as to answer some questions. The sister nods and gets up to walk towards you. You recognise her as Sister Catherina, who met you at the front gate. SISTER CATHERINA: Oh, adventurer. It is good to see you again. The Abbess says you would like to speak to me in regards to what I was doing before the evening service? NARRATOR: The Sister smiles politely. SISTER CATHERINA Well, I was in the scriptorium – in the basement - copying a manuscript from the Book of Saradomin. I’m going through the entire book, transcribing it all. There’s quite a lot, and, well, I think I’ve gotten quite good at it. It makes me feel somewhat proud, although I know that’s not a feeling I should indulge. Oh! But, uhm, I found it quite difficult though. What with the music and sounds of the party coming from outside the abbey. Do you know about that? It’s not that I disapprove of what they are doing, but I so used to love dancing before I joined here. It’s certainly tempting to join in.. NARRATOR: Sister Catherina shuffles, rubbing her arm. SISTER CATHERINA: I think, well...I know, Sister Anna wouldn’t be impressed by me saying that. She was quite strict and at first frightened me. I’m not surprised the applicant who was here yesterday left without a word. So...do you have any other questions for me? NARRATOR: It seems there is more that you could learn from Sister Catherina. Do you ask about the manuscript or the applicant?"

I heard Sister Anna asked her to sing, but wasn’t impressed with her efforts. She disappeared yesterday noon. She probably went home. A lot of applicants realise the life here isn't for them and leave. If it’s ok, I should return to my writing. I hope I have helped you in some way adventurer.

The abbess walks over to a sister, who surrounded by sheets of musical notation, appears to be leading the choir, waving her arms and conducting. The abbess beckons her to talk with you. SISTER CECILIA: Look at me...look at me... Okay, that's good. Remember to look at me so you can keep in time. Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't, er...Ladies, keep rehearsing. I need to talk to someone. ABBESS BENITA: Adventurer, this is Sister Cecilia. She leads the choir here in the abbey. Sister, would you be so kind as to tell the adventurer where you were yesterday evening? SISTER CECILIA: I was here. Leading the choir in practice of a new hymn to Saint Elspeth. I wrote the music, and might I add it's better music than those…dancers outside the abbey. I have no idea why they are here, but I detest dancing. It’s so...unthoughtful. So unholy. Do you know the story of Saint Elspeth and the Ripper Demon? I’d be happy to tell you. It’s a very important story to all the sisters here. NARRATOR: Do you ask about the story or the music?"

Stab them through the heart with terrible claws, tear off their faces... Zamorak, the god of chaos, sent the Ripper to attack a village where Saint Elspeth was staying. But, it couldn't approach while she was singing. Her voice and singing was so holy. So it waited on the edge of the village. She sang for days, but eventually she was too weak to go on. She went out of the village to face the demon alone - she thought it might just kill her and spare the villagers. A noble sacrifice. She fought the demon and it mortally wounded her; but, as she was dying, Saradomin granted her the strength to sing one piercing note so perfect that it struck the demon dead. Her remains lay unburied until the present age. Then, seventy years ago, a group of holy women found them and built this abbey in her memory. That's why music is such an important part of our worship. Now if you’ll excuse me, I really must get back to helping the choir.

NARRATOR: The abbess goes over to Sister Elena and explains that you have a few questions about her whereabouts yesterday evening, and about Sister Anna. She waits outside, leaving the two of you to talk. SISTER ELENA: I was here, in the kitchen making cabbage soup. Why, where should I have been? I went down to the cellar to get some supplies at one point, but the rest of the time I was here. Actually, I noticed something while I was down there. I think someone's been stealing food from the cellar. I bet it was Sister Catherina. I've seen her sneaking an extra cup of wine at meals, and I bet she’s just the sort to want to flirt with that rabble outside. As for Sister Anna...she's with Saradomin now. It doesn't matter what I thought of her, and it does no good to speak ill of the dead. Now. Is there something else you need? NARRATOR: Do you ask her about Sister Anna or how to make cabbage soup?"

You come to a room where the wooden hatch to the basement is open. Thundering down the stairs you enter into the dim light of the basement. A body lays stretched out, blood pooling around it on the stone floor. The pristine white robes now soaked in crimson along with the apron tied around the front. The apron of Sister Elena. Sister Cecilia cowers in the corner, shaking. SISTER CECILIA: I saw it! It was the demon! It was the Ripper! NARRATOR: End of Act 1. The next part of One Piercing Note will be available soon. The full quest can also be experienced in RuneScape. Visit RuneScape.com to find out more."
